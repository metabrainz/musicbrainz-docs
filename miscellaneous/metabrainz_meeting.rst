MetaBrainz Meeting
==================

Every Monday members of the MetaBrainz community gather on the :doc:`#metabrainz </miscellaneous/irc>` IRC channel to discuss whatever issues need discussing. On occasion the meeting is moved to a different day, but it is never moved to a different time slot: it always takes place at ":ref:`Regular Meeting Time <miscellaneous_metabrainz_meeting_regular_meeting_time>`" and should last for at most an hour.

Procedure
---------
The meeting will typically start off by "Reviews": people present talk about what they have been doing for the last week and sometimes their plans for the coming one. Following this will be whatever topics community members have added to the agenda during the week.

**Participation**
   Meetings typically include the core `MetaBrainz team <https://metabrainz.org/team>`_, volunteer project leaders, :doc:`student contributors </miscellaneous/summer_of_code>`, and a number of other members of the community - any community member is welcome to participate.

   To add a topic to the upcoming meeting's agenda, simply `edit the channel topic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands#TOPIC>`_ in #metabrainz.

**Reviews**
   The one leading the meeting will start off the meeting and pick the one to give their review first. Once someone has given their review, they pick the next person to give their review and whom then goes on to pick the next, until everybody who has posted reviews are done and the meeting moves on to other agenda items. Reviews should usually not take more than 3-5 minutes per person.

   Questions and commentary are welcome after a review, if kept brief. In these cases the next person should pause until discussion is resolved, and then resume/begin their review. Longer discussions should be held for after the meeting, or added to the agenda as a separate topic.

   If you wish to be a regular attendant of the meetings, you should add yourself to the list of `Regulars <https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MetaBrainz_Meeting/Regulars>`_ to be called on every meeting. Be sure to remove yourself or make a note if you're no longer going to regularly show up. :) (People who have missed a number of meetings without notice may also get removed and need to add themselves again to get put into the regular rotation.)

If you're unable to attend the meeting but would still like to give a review, you should send an e-mail to whoever is leading the meeting (sending to **community-manager@metabrainz.org** should be a safe option).

**Notes**
   Meeting notes will be posted on the MetaBrainz forums within 24 hours of a meeting, always following the same format. They can be found using the '`metabrainz-meeting-notes <https://community.metabrainz.org/tag/metabrainz-meeting-notes>`_' tag.
