The following sites are useful to find labels homepages:

   - `Google Directory 'Labels' <http://www.google.com/Top/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music/Labels/>`_
   - http://www.rlabels.com/
   - http://www.allrecordlabels.com/

Wikipedia has an extensive labels list, and a lot of articles:

   - `Wikipedia labels list page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_record_labels>`_

Discogs of course might prove useful: `Discogs <http://www.discogs.com/>`_

There is a `Discogs thread <https://www.discogs.com/group/thread/524527>`_ that lists some :doc:`Label Codes </terminology/terms/label_code>`.

There is a `German wikipedia article <http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Labelcodes>`_ has a lot of :doc:`Label Codes </terminology/terms/label_code>` too.

There is a `French web page <http://www.upfi.fr/index.php?page=adherents>`_ that lists all the labels that belong to the "Union des Producteurs phonographiques Français Indépendants" (UPFI). Information about most of the French independent labels can be found on this page.


Genre oriented resources
------------------------

**Jazz**

   - `Scott Yanow label page <http://www.trombone-usa.com/jazz-labels.htm>`_: useful for a quick heads-up about some labels
   - `Michael Fitzgerald label page <http://www.jazzdiscography.com/Labels>`_: has a *lot* of catalogs (although not really detailed)
   - `The jazz discography project <http://www.jazzdisco.org/>`_ does not have a lot of labels catalogs, but when they have one, it's good!
