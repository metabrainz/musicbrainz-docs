Guidelines
----------

See the general :doc:`guidelines for URLs </style_guides/relationships/url>`.

Many ASINs are valid across multiple Amazon stores. The preferred URL is for the store which matches the country of release.

An ASIN should represent the same release. If a release does not have an ASIN or the ASIN does not provide cover art, only the Cover Art Archive should be used to add cover art.
