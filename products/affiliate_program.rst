Tagger Affiliate Program
=========================

Overview
--------

MusicBrainz encourages third party application developers to create applications (taggers, or any type of application) that use MusicBrainz data. The authors of MusicBrainz enabled applications should pay MusicBrainz 10% of their registration fees in order to support the costs of operating the MusicBrainz project. Tagger authors who do not charge registration fees (e.g. open source developers) are exempt from this rule.

Any software author who wants to have their application prominently listed on the MusicBrainz site must enroll in the affiliate program. The terms of the affiliate program are:

- Applications in the program will have their application listed in the following places:

   - On the MusicBrainz home page
   - In the products menu of the MusicBrainz top level menu
   - On the :doc:`products </products/index>` page
   - Their own separate product page that describes the application (e.g. :doc:`AudioRanger </products/audioranger>`, :doc:`Yate Music Tagger </products/yate_music_tagger>`)

- Application authors agree to pay MusicBrainz at least 200EUR/250USD or 10% of their registrations per month, whichever is greater. There is no upper limit to the 10% registrations paid, since traffic from affiliate program users won't be equally capped.

- The 200EUR/250USD minimum fee is waived for the first two months of an application being in the affiliate program in hopes that two months of traffic can bring the application above the minimum fee.
