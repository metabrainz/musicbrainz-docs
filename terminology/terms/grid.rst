GRid
===========

The **Global Release Identifier** (**GRid**) is a system for uniquely identifying :doc:`releases </terminology/entities/release>` of music over electronic networks (that is, online stores where you can buy music as digital files). As that it can be seen as the equivalent of the :doc:`barcode </terminology/terms/barcode>` (or, more correctly, the GTIN) as found on physical releases of music. Like the :doc:`ISRC </terminology/terms/isrc>` (a code for identifying single recordings as found on releases), it was developed by the `IFPI <https://www.ifpi.org/>`_, but it does not appear to be a standard of the ISO.

MusicBrainz doesn't currently store GRids. In the future the barcode field of :doc:`releases </terminology/entities/release>` could be generalized to also accept GRids (but one would need a discriminator to state which code system is used).
