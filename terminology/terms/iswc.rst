ISWC
====

The **International Standard Musical Work Code** (ISWC) is an ISO standard similar to ISBNs for identifying musical works / compositions.

According to the `Wikipedia article about ISWC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Musical_Work_Code>`_, to register an ISWC, the following minimal metadata must be supplied:

   - title
   - names of all composers, arrangers and authors, with their role in the piece (identified by role code) and their :doc:`CAE </terminology/terms/cae>`/:doc:`IPI </terminology/terms/ipi>` number
   - work classification code (CIS)
   - identification of other works from it is derived

MusicBrainz stores ISWCs for :doc:`works </terminology/entities/work>`.

.. seealso::

   - :doc:`IPI </terminology/terms/ipi>`: a number identifying persons connected to ISWC registered works (authors, composers, etc.)
   - :doc:`ISRC </terminology/terms/isrc>`: an ISO standard for identifying recordings of music, developed by the IFPI
   - `Website of the registration authority <http://www.iswc.org/>`_
   - :ref:`List of work databases <entities_work_external_databases>`, many of which contain ISWCs
