Bots
====

This page is about programs written by :doc:`editors </terminology/terms/editor>` that automatically enter :doc:`edits </terminology/terms/edit>` into the database, called "bots". You can see a list of bots on the `Privileged User Accounts <https://musicbrainz.org/privileged>`_ page (although they are not privileged compared to editor/auto-editor accounts).

If you want to start your own bot, create a new account with a name that shows other editors that a) it is a bot and b) you are running it (e.g. "YOUR-NICK_bot"). Be sure to carefully test your program on the `test server <https://test.musicbrainz.org/>`_, and to comply to the :doc:`Code of Conduct for bots </guidelines/code_of_conduct_bots>`.

If you found a wrong bot edit and want to protect the :doc:`entity </terminology/entities/_entities>` from future wrong edits, make an entry in the appropriate `blacklist <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Bots/Blacklist>`_.
