Subscription
============

Subscriptions are a way for people to find and be notified of edits they are interested in. It is possible to subscribe to :doc:`artists </terminology/entities/artist>`, :doc:`collections </terminology/terms/collection>`, :doc:`labels </terminology/entities/label>`, :doc:`series </terminology/entities/series>` and :doc:`editors </terminology/terms/editor>`. By default, a daily digest is sent to your registered email address notifying you of all edits made the previous day to your subscriptions. This can be changed to weekly in the preferences or turned off entirely. If there were no edits during that period, no email will be sent regardless of which setting is used.

To subscribe, simply go to the relevant page and click the subscribe link in the sidebar.

Subscriptions are public by default. If you would like your subscriptions to be private, you can change `your preferences <https://musicbrainz.org/account/preferences>`_.
