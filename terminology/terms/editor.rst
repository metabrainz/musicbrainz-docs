Editor
======

An editor [#f1]_ is user who contributes to MusicBrainz by entering :doc:`edits </terminology/terms/edit>` into the :doc:`database </musicbrainz_database/index>`. All editors are expected to follow the MusicBrainz :doc:`Code of Conduct </guidelines/code_of_conduct>`.

Editors start as beginners, and eventually graduate to being just "editors". There are also further editor types that have special privileges, and require at least partially non-automated processes to be applied. There is a `list of editors with special privileges <https://musicbrainz.org/privileged>`_.

Beginner editor
---------------

Beginners can enter edits and leave edit notes to communicate with other editors. Every new MusicBrainz account starts with the Beginner editor status.

Editor
------

Editors can vote on other users' edits.

Moving from beginner editor to editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accounts must be more than 2 weeks old, have a verified email address, and more than 10 accepted edits (edits that have gone through the voting process and been accepted, rather than having automatically applied) to leave the "Beginner" category and be allowed to vote on edits.

.. _terms_editor_auto_editor:

Auto-editor
-----------

Auto-editors can make edits that are automatically approved without going through the :doc:`voting process </introductions/voting>`, and have the ability to approve other users' edits. Some, destructive, edit types cannot be approved.

Obligations of an auto-editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    *"With great power comes great responsibility"*
    -- Uncle Ben (of Spider Man fame)

Auto-editors should always align themselves to the :doc:`Code of Conduct </guidelines/code_of_conduct>`. Furthermore, they should be able to look beyond their nose and take an objective point of view regarding the data they edit. Being familiar with the various editing aspects of the site is important, as well as having a clear grasp of the :doc:`style guidelines </style_guides/_detailed_guides>`.

Additionally, while it is good to be an expert in certain areas of the database (e.g. certain musical genres or specific artists), every auto-editor should be comfortable enough with the basic editing fundamentals that they are able to edit outside their realm of expertise.

Becoming an auto-editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To become an auto-editor, you must be nominated by an existing auto-editor and then have your nomination put to a vote.

See `auto-editor election <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Auto-Editor_Election>`_ for more information.

.. _terms_editor_relationship_editor:

Relationship editor
-------------------

Relationship editors are users who have the ability to modify :doc:`relationship types and attributes </terminology/entities/relationship>` on the server.

In general, these changes are decided and implemented through the style process. If you feel that a relationship should be added or changed, please follow said :doc:`process </how-tos/proposals>`.

Transclusion editor
-------------------

Transclusion editors are users who have the permission to change the version of the transcluded :doc:`WikiDocs </miscellaneous/wikidocs>` documents, and thus update the documentation shown in the MusicBrainz /doc area.

Location editor
---------------

Location editors are users who have the ability to edit and add :doc:`areas </terminology/entities/area>`.

Account admin
-------------

Account admins are MetaBrainz employees who can change the privileges of other users (including both assigning the other types on this list, and revoking the privileges to edit, vote and leave edit notes). They can modify or remove any edit notes. They can also see additional data about editors, such as their email addresses.

Bot
---

:doc:`Bots </terminology/terms/bot>` are programs which automatically enter edits on behalf of a human.

For example, the `MBBE_Bot <https://musicbrainz.org/user/MBBE_Bot>`_ is an official bot maintained by MetaBrainz working on tasks requested in the :doc:`bug tracker </miscellaneous/bug_tracker>`.
