Cover Art Archive
=================

The `Cover Art Archive <https://coverartarchive.org/>`_ is a cooperation between the `Internet Archive <http://archive.org/>`_ and :doc:`MusicBrainz </miscellaneous/about>` to form a repository of music cover art (such as the covers of CDs) that is freely and easily accessible. The Cover Art Archive is stored on the Internet Archive's servers and curated by the MusicBrainz community. The images for any :doc:`release </terminology/entities/release>` are indexed by :doc:`MusicBrainz Release ID (MBID) </terminology/terms/mbid>`.
