Release Group
=============

A **release group**, as the name suggests, is used to group :doc:`releases </terminology/entities/release>` into a single logical entity. Every release belongs to one, and only one, release group.

Both release groups and releases are "albums" in a general sense. But there is an important difference: a release is something you can buy, such as a CD or a digital download, while a release group embraces the overall concept of an album.

When an artist says "We've released our new album", they're talking about a release group. When their publisher says "This new album gets released next week in Japan, and next month in Europe", they're referring to two different releases that belong in the aforementioned release group.

MusicBrainz automatically considers every release in the database to be part of a release group, even if the group only contains that one release. When a brand new release is added to the database, a new release group is automatically added.
