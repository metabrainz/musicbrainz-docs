Medium
======

In :doc:`MusicBrainz terminology </terminology/index>`, a prototypical medium is one of the physical, separate things you would get when you buy something in a record store. They are the individual CDs, vinyls, etc. contained within the packaging of an album (or any other type of :doc:`release </terminology/entities/release>`). Mediums are always included in a :doc:`release </terminology/entities/release>`, and have a position in said release (e.g. disc 1 or disc 2). They have a format, like CD, 12" vinyl or cassette (in some cases this will be unknown), and can have an optional title (e.g. disc 2: The Early Years).

Note that a side of a disc, like side A of a vinyl, is not its own medium; the whole vinyl disc is. Digital (as opposed to physical) releases don't have "real" mediums, but they should be entered as several mediums if they are officially divided in several "discs". Exceptions in the treatment of mediums can exist: DualDiscs are usually entered as two mediums if the tracklist is the same on both sides, but with different mixes.

:doc:`Disc IDs </terminology/terms/disc_id>` are linked to mediums.
