Recording
=========

A recording is an entity in MusicBrainz which can be linked to :doc:`tracks </terminology/entities/track>` on :doc:`releases </terminology/entities/release>`. Each track must always be associated with a single recording, but a recording can be linked to any number of tracks.

A recording represents distinct audio that has been used to produce at least one released track through copying or :ref:`mastering <terminology_mix_terminology>`. A recording itself is never produced solely through copying or mastering.

Generally, the audio represented by a recording corresponds to the audio at a stage in the production process before any final mastering but after any editing or :ref:`mixing <terminology_mix_terminology>`.

The diagram below shows some examples of recorded audio, recordings and released tracks and the relationships between them:
