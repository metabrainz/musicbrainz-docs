Relationship types
------------------

There are a huge number of different relationship types. The lists (organised per types of entities they connect) can be checked at the :doc:`relationship type table </relationships/relationship_types>`.

Guidelines
----------

Please see the :doc:`general guidelines for relationships </style_guides/relationships/index>`, the :doc:`guidelines for URLs </style_guides/relationships/url>`, and also the documentation for the specific relationship type you're using, accessible from the :doc:`relationship type table </relationships/relationship_types>`.

Credits
-------

Credits allow indicating that, for example, songwriting was credited to an artist's legal name, and not their main (performance) name.

Attributes
----------

Relationships can have attributes which modify the relationship. There is a :doc:`list of all attributes </relationships/relationship_attributes>`, but the attributes which are available, and how they should be used, depends on the relationship type, so see the documentation for the relationship you want to use for more information.

Dates
^^^^^

Some relationships have two date fields, a begin date and an end date, to store the period of time during which the relationship applied. The date can be the year, the year and the month or the full date. It is optional, so it can also be left blank. As with other attributes, see the documentation for the relationship types you are using.
