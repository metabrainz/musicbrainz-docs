Work
====

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

Type
----

Work types should only be used on works that specifically match the chosen type (not every work needs to have a work type!).

   - `Beethoven's Sonata Path√©tique <https://musicbrainz.org/work/c366ec5b-9d61-3057-827c-afd61a237b23>`_ is set to "Sonata", but `its first movement <https://musicbrainz.org/work/e1c58466-6c16-3e01-a52c-2483f041b84f>`_ should not have a type, since it's not itself a sonata (nor does it fit any other existing work type).

   - `Schubert's Winterreise <https://musicbrainz.org/work/16a894eb-3164-4e69-b2e3-d0b1db71c2a8>`_ is set to "Song-cycle", while `its first part, Gute Nacht <https://musicbrainz.org/work/485e9c1b-8b7f-32cd-8511-83f0259088e8>`_ is set to "Song".

   - `John Williams' soundtrack for Star Wars, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back <https://musicbrainz.org/work/2df0e3f6-8007-41ee-b4d7-fda3e3657597>`_ is set to "Soundtrack", but `the Imperial March <https://musicbrainz.org/work/c06f8010-b294-3c41-be3e-da4a834668e4>`_ should not be, since it's not itself a soundtrack, just part of one.

Disambiguation comment
----------------------

Add :doc:`disambiguation comments </terminology/terms/disambiguation>` only when two (or more) works are similar enough to be confused, not just because they have the same name. For example, there's not much use in adding "Scorpions song" to `Blackout <https://musicbrainz.org/work/ffbdb1ba-cc7d-37e4-907e-3d5abf4a8d56>`_ just because other artists have songs called Blackout. On the other hand, a translation of a work with the same name as the original might deserve a disambiguation to make it more obvious, like with `Dreams come true <https://musicbrainz.org/work/0f984c2c-0734-301f-bfc2-a15095f0d21c>`_ ("Japanese version") by BoA and the original `Korean version <https://musicbrainz.org/work/ea62b94f-615a-3a74-b276-26f3cafbb077>`_.
