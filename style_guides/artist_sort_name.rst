Artist Sort Name
================

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

This page describes how to format an artist's sort name.

Guidelines
----------

   1. Person artist names have sort name "family name, given name".

      (a) Middle names and nicknames should be treated as a part of the given name.
      (b) Names beginning with an abbreviated title, such as Dr., DJ, or MC should have the title treated as if it were a part of the given name.
      (c) Family names which begin with an abbreviation should have the abbreviation expanded in the sort name.
      (d) Suffixes like "Jr." and "Sr." should be listed after the given name.

   .. newline between bullets

   2. Group artist names beginning with an article (a, an, the, etc.) have the article moved to the end of their sort name.

      (a) Where a real person's name appears in a group artist's name, the artist's sort name should be the sort name for that person, followed by the remainder of the group artist's name.

   .. newline between bullets

   3. The main artist sort name should be in Latin script for compatibility reasons. If the artist's name is normally written using a non-Latin script, use the Latin script translated or transliterated name by which the artist is most commonly known. Alias sort names should use the appropriate script for the locale.

   .. newline between bullets

   4. For artist names containing stylized characters, change those characters to their equivalent Latin script letter, removing any style-only punctuation, spacing, or other characters, unless the artist's name contains only stylized characters, which have no inherent meaning to translate, and which cannot be transliterated.

   .. newline between bullets

   5. Artist sort names should retain all Latin diacritics present in the artist name.

   .. newline between bullets

   6. Numerals present in the artist name do not change.

   .. newline between bullets

   7. All disparate parts of a sort name should be separated by ", " (comma and space).
