Miscellaneous
=============

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

This page is for small guidelines that don't need their own page.

Use of special characters
-------------------------

Use of basic ASCII punctuation characters such as ' and " is allowed, but typographically-correct punctuation (such as â€™ for the English apostrophe) is preferred. The :doc:`Classical Style Guide </style_guides/classical/_classical>` has its own rules about punctuation in titles; please follow that guideline where it applies. Use normal Latin letters for Roman numerals: their Unicode versions exist only for compatibility purposes and its use is `discouraged by the standard (p.754) <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch22.pdf>`_.

As always, :ref:`Artist intent <style_guides_principles_artist_intent>` overrides this guideline.


"Top something" Playlists
-------------------------

Bootleg torrents that are compilations based on playlists of charts authorities (like Billboard's) should not be stored in MusicBrainz as releases. These playlists are often copyrighted by their issuers.
