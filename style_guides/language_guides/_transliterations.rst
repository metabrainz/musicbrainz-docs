Transliterations
================

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

Transliteration is the conversion from one script to another, e.g., from Latin to Kanji, Kanji to Cyrillic, Cyrillic to Hebrew, etc. Often, releases will be transliterated for the benefit of people who enjoy the music but cannot read the original script. While transliteration to the Latin script is the most common, it is not the only possibility.

Guideline
---------

Transliterated :doc:`pseudo-releases </style_guides/types_of_releases/pseudo-releases>` [1]_ should conform to the rules of the transliteration system used.

Some languages have specific capitalization guidelines for transliterations:

.. toctree::

   /style_guides/language_guides/chinese
   /style_guides/language_guides/hebrew
   /style_guides/language_guides/japanese
   /style_guides/language_guides/yiddish

For any other transliterations to scripts that have a capitalization concept [2]_:

If the source script also has a capitalization concept, keep the original capitalization. Otherwise, then only the first letter of each sentence and proper nouns should be capitalized.


.. rubric:: Notes

.. [1] At the time this guideline is being adopted, :doc:`NGS </terminology/terms/ngs>` is getting close. In NGS, capitalization of :ref:`official releases <entities_release_status>` should not be normalized. This guideline is limited to pseudo-releases in order to avoid such "destructive" capitalization changes.
.. [2] Scripts that have a capitalization concept include `Armenian <https://www.omniglot.com/writing/armenian.htm>`_, `Cyrillic <https://www.omniglot.com/writing/cyrillic.htm>`_, `Deseret <https://www.omniglot.com/writing/deseret.htm>`_, `Georgian (Mkhedruli) <https://www.omniglot.com/writing/georgian2.htm>`_, `Greek <https://www.omniglot.com/writing/greek.htm>`_ and `Latin <https://www.omniglot.com/writing/latin.htm>`_.
