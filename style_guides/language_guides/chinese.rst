Chinese
=======

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

Han Script
----------

Chinese characters, also known as Han characters, have no capitalization.


Latin Script
------------

Chinese releases may be transliterated into Latin script, usually as Pseudo-Releases. While there are many romanization systems for Chinese, `Hanyu Pinyin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Pinyin>`_ is the most common in MusicBrainz. In Hanyu Pinyin, only the first letter of a sentence and proper nouns should be capitalized. [1]_

**Examples:**

   - `Bā dù kōngjiān <https://musicbrainz.org/release/5193d964-d732-4d81-a99f-37f8e5bb14bb>`_ (Hanyu Pinyin transliteration of `八度空間 <https://musicbrainz.org/release/58834222-e36a-49fe-b71e-27436faed9ce>`_)
   - `Wáng Fēi <https://musicbrainz.org/release/d3682b57-863f-46c5-ac0d-c5efb6f80dc5>`_ (Hanyu Pinyin transliteration of `王菲 <https://musicbrainz.org/release/1f4c4892-2039-4545-9658-5f15248c7861>`_)


Multiple Languages
------------------

When foreign languages are mixed with Chinese in release or track titles they should be capitalized according to the :doc:`Capitalization Standard </style_guides/language_guides/_language_guides>` of that language. [2]_

**Examples:**

   - `I Love You 無望 <https://musicbrainz.org/recording/e58d3db9-7755-43d5-b9d4-0064300033eb>`_
   - `親愛的Jazz <https://musicbrainz.org/recording/afe527e5-e377-4f2b-8e9e-ce573cbf9a4c>`_
   - `Rock'n Roll的Style <https://musicbrainz.org/recording/8169e429-1057-47d8-849e-ed3c670b850d>`_
