Catalogues
----------

A catalogue must be officially published for it to be added as such, and it must be significant; it is not sufficient that someone simply wrote down a list of all the songs by a group.

**Lists of works by opus number**

As an exception to the previous guideline, if a composer (or their publisher) assigned opus numbers to their compositions, it is allowed to add a catalogue series for them even if no catalogue as such has been published. These should be named "Works of Composer by opus number", using the composer's standard name in English (like `Works of Dmitri Shostakovich by opus number <https://musicbrainz.org/series/a761449c-eb51-43c9-a8bc-9b318079d99f>`_).
