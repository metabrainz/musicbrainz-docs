English (Classical Music)
=========================

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

This is the guideline for titles or parts of titles in English. Do **not** assume that anything expressed here is valid for other languages.


Catalogue & number
------------------

Catalogues should always be preceded by comma and space.

Opus and number should always be lower-cased and abbreviated: op. and no. There should be a space before the number.

Specific catalogues (eg. Köchel) should follow their usual capitalization.

**Examples**

   - *op. 4*
   - *op. 27 no. 3*
   - *Symphony no. 5*
   - *String Quartet in D major, op. 11*


Keys
----

The word "in" should always precede the key name. The key itself should be in upper case, except on releases where lowercase is used to express a minor key (see below).

**Sharp/flat**

If the key name contain the words "sharp" or "flat", they should be in lower case and a hyphen should be used as delimiter.

**Major/minor**

The words "major" & "minor" are always lower-cased. Do not add "major" or "minor" if these words are omitted in the source; tonality is sometimes expressed with capitalization (upper case = major, lower case = minor), or omission (naked key = major, "minor" printed).

Using "major" or "minor" is the preferred style for generic Works titles in English.

**Examples**

   - *Sonata in C-sharp minor*
   - *Symphony in E major*
   - *Suite no. 4 in E-flat (major omitted, but implied) - but work Suite no. 4 in E-flat major*
   - *Concerto in c (lowercase implies minor) - but work Concerto in C minor*


Capitalization
--------------

English titles in general should follow MusicBrainz's :doc:`standard capitalization for English </style_guides/language_guides/english>`, but librettos and quotes should always follow sentence style.

**Quotation marks**

Always use :doc:`double quotes </style_guides/miscellaneous>` (as opposed to single quotes or other types of quotation marks) in English titles.

**Examples**

   - *Songs of Travel: The Roadside Fire*
   - *Songs of Travel: Bright is the ring of words*
   - *Nocturne from "A Midsummer Night's Dream"*
   - *"Träume" - "Schmerzen" from the "Wesendonck" Lieder*
