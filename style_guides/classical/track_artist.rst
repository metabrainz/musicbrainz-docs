Track Artist
============

The :doc:`Track </terminology/entities/track>` Artist field should contain just the composer; not the performer(s). Use special artist [unknown] if you cannot find out who the composer is (the name of the composer is often printed directly above the track or group of tracks on classical releases).

   - Use the most detailed tracklist available (e.g. inside booklet on a CD release)
   - If there is more than one composer involved on the track, try to find out how the work is usually credited.

**Rationale**

Usually in MusicBrainz the Track Artist field should contain the Artist as credited for that track. However, classical releases do not have a single track-specific "artist" like pop releases commonly do. A classical track has (usually) one composer, and any number of performers.

**Examples**

   - `Partita V in G major, BWV 829: IV. Sarabande <https://musicbrainz.org/release/ce31b6c4-9463-4026-8089-800dd7147678>`_ Johann Sebastian Bach
