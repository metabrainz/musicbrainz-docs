Recording Artist
================

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

The :doc:`Recording </terminology/entities/recording>` Artist field should contain the most important performers who appear on that specific recording, but it is acceptable that newly-created recordings have their artist information derived from a tracklist. Use a comma between multiple artists.

Note that this field is just a summary. To credit performers properly, you should always link the performers to the appropriate recordings using Advanced Relationships.

   - If the release lists all performers who appear on the release, be careful to only add performers who actually contributed to the specific recording.
   - If no performer info can be found, use special artist [unknown].
