Release Title
=============

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

Sources
-------

For releases of physical media, the Release Title will be sourced from the front cover. When a physical cover is not available, find the title at a reliable online source. For digital media, use the label's page or other official source. Avoid using information from resellers.

**Release Title**

The Release title should not contain performers unless they are clearly part of the title as in "Bernstein Conducts Stravinsky." The Release title should not contain composers except for titled releases containing their names as above, or for multi-composer releases as outlined below.

**Titled releases**

No difference from other Release Titles in MusicBrainz.

**Single work releases**

Use the title as printed and apply correct capitalisation and punctuation as stated in the :doc:`language guidelines </style_guides/language_guides/_language_guides>`. Note that quotes in English should be in sentence style.

**A list of works**

Use the works as credited and separate them with a slash.

**Title and a list of works**

If a release contains both a title and a list of works it is recommended that only the title is used.

**A list of works by different composers**

For every work, add the composer(s) as credited. Separate the composer(s) from the work with a colon.

If the title has several works by the same composer(s) in a row, add the composer(s) to the first one only.

**Multi-language titles**

The release title and tracklist should match, if possible.

   - *Don't add your own translation unless you are entering a pseudo-release.*

**A list of composers**

In rare cases there are no credited works, only composers, separate composers with a slash.

Release Group Title
-------------------

Classical releases are often multilingual, and the standard guidelines for selecting a Release Group title in MusicBrainz may not work. See if one language is highlighted: bold typeface, bigger letters or similar.

If the title differs between different releases in the same release group, try to find the most used version. If that fails, use the earliest release.
