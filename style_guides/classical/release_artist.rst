Release Artist
==============

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

The purpose of the Release Artist field is to assign releases to specific artists. Crediting performers is done by linking artists and recordings with an Advanced Relationship.

Sources
-------

**Physical Media**

For releases of physical media, the release artist will be sourced from the front cover. When a physical cover is not available, find the featured writers and performers at a reliable online source.

The spine can be used if it should happen to contain more detail than the front cover.

**Digital media**

Preferably from the label's page or other official source. Avoid using information from resellers.

Featured Release Artists
------------------------

The :ref:`Release Artist <entities_release_title>` of a classical Release should include the writers (composers, lyricists, librettists) and performers featured on the front cover (except when "Various Artists" is used, see below). Use only writers and performers who are featured on the front cover (or the spine); don't add artists from the back cover or the inside of the booklet or other places.

**Single artist**

If there is only one name on the front cover. This is uncommon for classical releases (usually the composer and a couple of performers will be listed), but sometimes is seen on solo recitals or composer anthologies.

**Multiple artists**

Use a comma to separate names. If the credits contain both writers and performers, begin with the writers. Use a semicolon to separate writers from performers.

**Names that are not prominently featured**

If there is a long list of names on the cover, only the most prominently featured names need to be included. For example when a single performer (or group) performs works from many different composers, or vice-versa. See below for information about when to use "Various Artists".

**Various Artists**

There are some releases that don't really have any featured artists. For example there are classical "samplers", often released by record labels or newspapers. Other examples include compilation albums with names like "Classics for Relaxing": these often have no artist credits at all. In these cases, use the special artist `Various Artists <https://musicbrainz.org/artist/89ad4ac3-39f7-470e-963a-56509c546377>`_.


Release Groups
--------------

Will in many cases have the same name and artists as the release. If the featured artists differs between different releases in the same release group, try to find the most used version. If that fails, use the earliest release.
