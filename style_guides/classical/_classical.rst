Classical Music
===============

Status: **Official Style Guideline**

Introduction
------------
The Classical Style Guide (CSG) is a set of guidelines that explains how (and when) "classical" music should be handled differently from "non-classical" in MusicBrainz. "Classical" is used here in the broadest sense, and is not meant to refer specifically to the `Classical Period <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_period_(music)>`_ in Western music.
