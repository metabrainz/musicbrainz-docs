Cancelling an Edit
==================

What
----

If an edit has not yet been :ref:`applied <introductions_voting_applying_edits>`, the editor who submitted that edit can cancel it.

When
----

If you submit an edit and then realize that it was incorrect, the easiest solution is often to cancel the edit and start over.

On the other hand, there are times when a series of edits are inter-dependent, and cancelling only one of them is not possible. In these cases, you should enter a new edit to correct the old one.

If you're not sure whether cancelling is appropriate, :doc:`ask </miscellaneous/contact>`.

How
----

When viewing your own open (unapplied) edits, you will see a button at the right side of the screen, :guilabel:`Cancel edit`.

1. Click the button
2. Enter an :doc:`edit note </terminology/terms/edit_note>` explaining why you're cancelling, and
3. Click :guilabel:`Cancel edit` again to confirm

Where
-----

There are several places to find your open edits, including:

* From your profile page, click the :guilabel:`Open edits` tab
* In the edit history for a particular :doc:`entity </terminology/entities/index>`
    * Click the :guilabel:`Edit history` link in the right sidebar 
* Using the `edit search page <https://musicbrainz.org/search/edits>`_
